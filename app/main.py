"""JSON merge, patch, diff and validation service.

* ``POST /merge`` accepts ``{"base": ..., "left": ..., "right": ...}`` and
  merges the changes that left and right each made relative to base:

  * a change made on only one side is taken;
  * identical changes on both sides are taken;
  * objects are merged key by key, recursively;
  * arrays are compared as a whole (never merged element-wise);
  * conflicting changes (same path, different values, or one side deleting a
    subtree the other side modified) produce a 409 response listing every
    conflict, sorted by JSON Pointer (RFC 6901).

* ``POST /patch`` accepts ``{"document": ..., "operations": [...]}`` and
  atomically applies RFC 6902 ``add`` / ``remove`` / ``replace`` / ``test``
  operations to a deep copy of the document. Malformed requests yield 422;
  unresolvable paths, out-of-bounds array indices and failed ``test``
  operations yield 409 without any partial result.

* ``POST /patch/invert`` accepts the same request as ``/patch`` and, on
  success, returns the resulting ``document`` together with
  ``inverse_operations``: RFC 6902 operations which applied in the returned
  order reconstruct the original document exactly. Every inverse is derived
  from the real value present immediately before that step, so object
  overwrites, ``/-`` appends and array index shifts invert precisely;
  ``test`` operations validate but produce no inverse. Failures reuse the
  ``/patch`` 409/422 responses and never return partial results.

* ``POST /diff`` accepts ``{"source": ..., "target": ...}`` and returns the
  RFC 6902 ``operations`` that transform source into target; objects are
  compared recursively by member (RFC 6901 escaping included) and arrays are
  aligned by longest common subsequence, so common positions are recursed
  rather than replaced wholesale.

* ``POST /canonicalize`` accepts ``{"document": ...}`` and returns the
  RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical JSON text together with its SHA-256 digest.

* ``POST /validate`` accepts ``{"schema": ..., "document": ...}`` and
  validates the document against the schema as JSON Schema Draft 2020-12.
  Only document-local ``#`` references are allowed; remote references,
  invalid schemas and unresolvable local references yield 422. A valid
  schema always yields 200 with ``valid`` and (on failure) every leaf
  error as RFC 6901 paths, sorted by instance path and keyword.

* ``POST /redact`` accepts ``{"document": ..., "rules": [...]}`` where each
  rule pairs a JSON Pointer glob ``path`` (``*`` matches exactly one
  level, ``**`` any depth including zero, arrays included) with an
  ``action``: ``remove``, ``mask`` (replace with ``"***"``) or ``hash``
  (replace with the SHA-256 of the value's RFC 8785 canonical form). All
  rules are validated up front (422); every rule is matched against the
  original document and, when several rules hit the same path, the one
  with fewer wildcards wins, then the one with more path tokens, then the
  one declared first. The response carries the redacted deep copy plus
  every matched RFC 6901 path; a ``remove`` winning at the root is a 409.
